# Java Shop Project

Welcome to the Java Shop Project! This project is maintained by students of the class with the purpose of providing a hands-on learning experience in Java programming. The project simulates a basic shop management system where students can learn and contribute to various aspects of software development including coding, testing, documentation, and collaboration.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to educate students by engaging them in real-world software development scenarios. By actively participating in this project, students will gain practical experience in Java programming, software design, version control, and teamwork. Additionally, they will learn about software development methodologies such as Agile, as well as best practices in code documentation and testing.

## Features

The Java Shop Project aims to include the following features:

- **Product Management**: Adding, removing, and updating products in the shop inventory.
- **Order Management**: Placing orders, processing payments, and managing order history.
- **User Authentication**: Authenticating users and managing their profiles.
- **Reporting**: Generating reports on sales, inventory, and customer data.
- **GUI Interface**: Implementing a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing and executing unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Contributing

We encourage students to actively contribute to the project in any of the following ways:

- **Coding**: Implement new features, fix bugs, or refactor existing code.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and perform integration testing to ensure software quality.
- **Documentation**: Update README files, write code comments, and maintain project documentation.
- **Design**: Participate in discussions on software design and architecture.
- **Review**: Review pull requests, provide feedback, and help improve code quality.
